## Hello! Welcome to My Github profile:

I am a data analyst with a practical understanding of how to use data for business success, providing actionable insights that empower organizations
to make informed decisions and drive growth. 

With strong expertise in handling large datasets and complex analytical tasks using programming technologies(SQL & Python) and business intelligence tools(Power BI and Looker Studio) you can always count on me to fix you data related challenges!

You can preview some of my projects from the [Repositories](https://github.com/JachimmaChristian?tab=repositories) section of Github. 

When I'm not learning or working on a project you'd find me listening to my favorite podcasts or watching "Suits" or "Big Bang Theory" on Netflix for the nth time :)

To get in touch, send an email or message me on LinkedIn. 

I don't bite! :D 

## Welcome again!
