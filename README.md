<summary><b> üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇ About Me (Click to view): </b></summary>
  <p> 
I'm a Data analyst keen to answer business questions by analyzing data for business growth. I have a background in Engineering, Materials & Metallurgical Engineering to be precise with strong project management skills honed through my work experience as a project manager for over 3years. 

A skilled data analyst with industry experience in collecting, organizing, reporting, analyzing, visualizing, interpreting and disseminating analytical findings. Energetic presenter and confident communicator with the ability to visualize data clearly and efficiently in a beneficial way for the stakeholder. Creative in finding solutions to problems and determining modifications for optimal use of organizational data. Organized and timely in providing staff, departmental members, and executive management with reports on specific data findings and their impact on organizational growth and success.

Currently, I freelance for organizations and individuals in data analytics-related projects while volunteering with Oppia Foundation.

I have excellent communication skills and attention to detail and I am great at working in teams. I am happy working alone with my head deep in numbers or working as a motivated part of a team to consistently contribute to team efforts and organizational improvements. I am open-minded and focused on new developments in my field. I have proven to be effective and highly motivated, with proficiency in leadership and collaborative work. 

I enjoy brainstorming and coordinating efforts to achieve a common goal.

Outside of data analytics, I'm a reader, and I enjoy watching "Suits"!
